## üí∏ Cost Optimization

- **Free Tier Resources**: Use t3.micro instances, 750 hours/month
- **DynamoDB**: Pay-per-request billing for variable workloads
- **S3**: Lifecycle policies for automated archival to cheaper storage classes
- **Monitoring**: AWS Cost Explorer and billing alerts setup
- **Resource Cleanup**: Automated scripts to remove unused resources


## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues

**Permission Denied Errors:**
```bash
# Check current user permissions
aws sts get-caller-identity
aws iam list-attached-user-policies --user-name $(aws sts get-caller-identity --query User.UserName --output text)
```

**Resource Limits:**
```bash
# Check service quotas
aws service-quotas list-service-quotas --service-code ec2
aws service-quotas list-service-quotas --service-code rds
```

**Region Availability:**
```bash
# Verify service availability in region
aws ec2 describe-regions --query 'Regions[?RegionName==`us-east-1`]'
```
